An emulator of user behavioural actions for SPAs. Could be used as a part of Remote Control functionality.

### Demo

1. Open https://artsiom.mezin.eu/preoccupyjs/demo.
2. Click **Activate remote control**.
3. Click **Control** to open a new tab, it's going to open a new tab.
4. In the new tab click **Connect**. You will see a system dialog to choose the window to broadcast the screen media. Please, select the third tab with the title "Chrome Tab". From the options list select the tab with the title "PreoccupyJS. Test Application".
5. Enjoy!

### Usage

The main idea of the PreoccupyJS package is to emulate users actions within a remote controlled SPA and to change the SPA's DOM accordingly.

Under the hood PreoccupyJS consists of the next main parts:
1. [Host](http://artsiom.mezin.eu/preoccupyjs/docs/classes/host.html) - A class for the tab (machine) who is going to take controll of the remote machine.
2. [Client](http://artsiom.mezin.eu/preoccupyjs/docs/classes/client.html) - A class for the tab (machine) who is going to be controlled remotly.
3. [Actions](http://artsiom.mezin.eu/preoccupyjs/docs/classes/baseaction.html) - A quantum of information which is colleceted from the Host side and describes a single user action (like click, mousemove, scroll, etc...). Each action is transmitted to the Client tab (machine) and performed over there by the Transport.
4. [Transport](http://artsiom.mezin.eu/preoccupyjs/docs/interfaces/abstracttransport.html) - An abstract class which describes how actions is going to be transmitted from the host tab to the client one.

**PreoccupyJS doesn't provide an opportunity to grab, broadcast, or present a Screen Media stream. You have to take care about this part of fuctionality separetly.**

### Features

 - Module structure. You can reuse existing Actions or replace/extend it by your own
 - Transport agnostic. It's up to you how to transmit the actions between host and client browser tabs

### Importing library

You can import the generated bundle to use the whole library generated by this starter:

```javascript
import { createHost, createClient } from 'preoccupyjs';
```

Additionally, you can import the transpiled modules (transports, actions) from `dist/lib`:

```javascript
import { DblClickToAction } from 'preoccupyjs/lib/actions/DblClickToAction';
```

### NPM scripts

 - `npm t`: Run test suite
 - `npm start`: Run `npm run build` in watch mode
 - `npm run test:watch`: Run test suite in [interactive watch mode](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/cli.html#watch)
 - `npm run test:prod`: Run linting and generate coverage
 - `npm run build`: Generate bundles and typings, create docs
 - `npm run lint`: Lints code
 - `npm run commit`: Commit using conventional commit style ([husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) will tell you to use it if you haven't :wink:)

### Excluding peerDependencies

On library development, one might want to set some peer dependencies, and thus remove those from the final bundle. You can see in [Rollup docs](https://rollupjs.org/#peer-dependencies) how to do that.

Good news: the setup is here for you, you must only include the dependency name in `external` property within `rollup.config.js`. For example, if you want to exclude `lodash`, just write there `external: ['lodash']`.

### Automatic releases

_**Prerequisites**: you need to create/login accounts and add your project to:_
 - [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
 - [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org)
 - [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io)

_**Prerequisite for Windows**: Semantic-release uses
**[node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp)** so you will need to
install
[Microsoft's windows-build-tools](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools)
using this command:_

```bash
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
```

#### Setup steps

Follow the console instructions to install semantic release and run it (answer NO to "Do you want a `.travis.yml` file with semantic-release setup?").

_Note: make sure you've setup `repository.url` in your `package.json` file_

```bash
npm install -g semantic-release-cli
semantic-release-cli setup
# IMPORTANT!! Answer NO to "Do you want a `.travis.yml` file with semantic-release setup?" question. It is already prepared for you :P
```

From now on, you'll need to use `npm run commit`, which is a convenient way to create conventional commits.

Automatic releases are possible thanks to [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), which publishes your code automatically on [github](https://github.com/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), plus generates automatically a changelog. This setup is highly influenced by [Kent C. Dodds course on egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-write-an-open-source-javascript-library)

### Git Hooks

There is already set a `precommit` hook for formatting your code with Prettier :nail_care:

By default, there are two disabled git hooks. They're set up when you run the `npm run semantic-release-prepare` script. They make sure:
 - You follow a [conventional commit message](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog)
 - Your build is not going to fail in [Travis](https://travis-ci.org) (or your CI server), since it's runned locally before `git push`

This makes more sense in combination with [automatic releases](#automatic-releases)

### FAQ

#### `Array.prototype.from`, `Promise`, `Map`... is undefined?

TypeScript or Babel only provides down-emits on syntactical features (`class`, `let`, `async/await`...), but not on functional features (`Array.prototype.find`, `Set`, `Promise`...), . For that, you need Polyfills, such as [`core-js`](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) or [`babel-polyfill`](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/) (which extends `core-js`).

For a library, `core-js` plays very nicely, since you can import just the polyfills you need:

```javascript
import "core-js/fn/array/find"
import "core-js/fn/string/includes"
import "core-js/fn/promise"
...
```
